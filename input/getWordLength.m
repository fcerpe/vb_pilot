function out_num = getWordLength(in_str)
% COMPUTE WORD LENGTH Length in pixels of a given word

% Calculate the length in pixels of a given word, functional to presentation box
% Length is obtained by the sum of the single lengths of letters composing
% the word itself.
% The whole is different from the sum of its parts, yes. But we need to
% manipulate spaces, so the pre-existing ones between letters do not matter
% here. 
% For (each) word:
% - splits it into the single letters
% - map letters into the coordinates for the least rectangle around it
% (refer to frBr tables, already computed)
% - calculate x difference (x position of the second point - x position of
% the first point)
% - sum them to obtain the word length on the x axis
